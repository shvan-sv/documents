=========

This is how we have planned and been doing it as per the main document... (shared with you)

Stage A - INTERPRETER STAGE
	a) Write a Python based interpreter
Result: 	(i)  We have created a command line interpreter using Python
	(ii) We have done lexical analysis for 4 mathematical operators 	
	for two operands at least, as of now
	(iii) We are trying for more than two operators
Next goal of Stage A
	(iv) We will now have to create a PARSER for our goals such as 		operator precedences or applying BODMAS with tokenizing 	expressions inside the brackets
